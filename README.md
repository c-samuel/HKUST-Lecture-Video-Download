# Download HKUST Lecture Video

Download the HKUST streaming lecture video by parsing and getting the ts url link, then download them individually.

## Alternative & easier way to Download Lecture Video

There's a great open-source extension developed for Chrome, and it's working as of 20/12/2018. Feel free to use it for a quick solution:
[HLS-Downloader](https://github.com/puemos/hls-downloader-chrome-extension)

## How to use

1. Log in UST CAS / [UST canvas](https://canvas.ust.hk)
2. Go to the lecture video URL, such as `https://ptz141.ust.hk/rvcprotected/mp4:18FA_CIVL1160-L1_181022_45315.mp4/media_w1817981_6.ts?UId=XXXXXX&SessionId=XXXXXXXXXX`
3. Open the browser development console, in Chrome for example, by `cmd` + `option` + `j`
4. Copy and paste the code from `index.js` to Chrome console

The lecture video ts files will then download automatically, and will stop after all files are downloaded, usually 4xx ~ 5xx files for a lecture class.

## How to combine the ts files

If you don't want to store so many separate files, you could combine them into one.

### Mac / Linux

Type the following commands in the terminal:

```Shell
printf '%s\n' *.ts(n) > tslist
while read line; do cat $line >> full.ts; done < tslist
```

:point_up_2: Might have even simplier ways to do it, feel free to let me know

### Python script

Run the concat python script by `python3 concat.py`
